01 - Architecture


Bricktop is a simple and very lightweight framework, the system is
quite small.

If we want to start a new project then we just take a new copy of the
bricktop directory which would contain the following by default


    app/
    doc/
    plugins/
    src/
    styles/
    index.html


The app/ directory is empty by default - this is where you, the
developer, would put your own application-specific code.

The doc/ directory contains this and other documentation files.

The plugins/ directory normally contains nothing more than jquery,
if you want to include other plugins you would put the code in
here.

The src/ directory contains all of the core application code, this
is probably the most important directory to us and will be further
examned in 02-Core.txt

The styles/ dicrectory contains stylesheets. Bricktop comes with
a set of default sheets that can be used in your application or
you can create your own.

Lastly - the index.html file which is the main entry point for
an application.
